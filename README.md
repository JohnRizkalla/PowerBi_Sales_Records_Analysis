  # Insights

  #### 1. There is a Drop in every 1st 2 Qtrs. in each year so need to dig deeper to validate these drops.
  #### 2. A recommendation for the company to reduce cost it might consider removing a product like "Sunshine" 
  as it has the highest sold units with a relatively low Net Sales or sales can be increased by increasing its price.
  #### 3. Next in action is to extract the Bottom 10 Sales Reps and look for ways of improvements.
